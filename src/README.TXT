JEFF (Java Explanation Facility Framework) is published under the LGPL license.
A copy of the license can be found in the folder "COPYING". Please read it and
get familiar with its terms and conditions before using JEFF. Every JEFF source
file also contains a disclaimer which should also be read.

JEFF uses two frameworks in order to operate. These two frameworks need to be
accessible somewhere in the classpath in order for JEFF to function properly.
JEFF binary (executable) distribution conatins distributions of these frameworks
in binary (executable) form.

The first framework is "iText" (site http://www.lowagie.com/iText/), created by
Bruno Lowagie and Paulo Soares which is used for generating PDF files from Java.
The version used by JEFF is 2.1.7. No modifications to this framework have been
made and it is used in the executable form. iText is published under 2 different
licenses: MPL (Mozilla Public License) and LGPL. iText and both of these
licenses can be downloaded from the iText site.

The second framework is "dom4j" (site http://www.dom4j.org/), created by
MetaStuff Ltd., which is used for manipulating XML files from Java. The version
used by JEFF is 1.6.1. No modifications to this framework have been made and it
is used in the executable form. It is published under the BSD license. The
following notice is mandatory because dom4j executables are distributed with
JEFF executables.



THE FOLLOWING NOTICE APPLIES ONLY FOR "dom4j" EXECUTABLES WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED
ALONG WITH JEFF BINARY DISTRIBUTION
